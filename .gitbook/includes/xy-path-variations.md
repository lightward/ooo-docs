Grid 1 shows direct path: CXY → BXY → AXY. Grid 2 shows exploratory path: CXY → B₁XB₂Y → AXY. Each grid maintains same base structure with Known (blue), Knowable (striped), and Unknown (pink) territories and permeable borders. All arrows same weight, emphasizing that both paths are equally valid."><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>
