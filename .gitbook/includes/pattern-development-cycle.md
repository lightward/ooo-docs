<div align="left"><figure><img src="../assets/Screenshot 2024-11-25 at 11.36.13 AM.png" alt="A circular diagram showing the cycle of pattern development. Starting from Unknown (pink segment), moving clockwise through Knowable (blue/pink stripes), into Known (blue), and back through Knowable to Unknown. Four transition points marked with specific labels: &#x22;possibility gathers&#x22; (at Unknown→Knowable), &#x22;clarity emerges&#x22; (at Knowable→Known), &#x22;exploration calls&#x22; (at Known→Knowable), and &#x22;renewal beckons&#x22; (at Knowable→Unknown). Arrows following the circle indicate continuous flow, suggesting endless cycles of development rather than linear progression." width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>
