<figure><img src="../assets/Screenshot 2024-11-26 at 12.05.02â€¯PM.png" alt="Three square-ish panels showing ground-finding sequence. All share pink Unknown backdrop and large circular Known (earth-blob) protruding up from bottom with visible Knowable membrane at its edges. First panel shows smaller Known blob with three dots in horizontal line pressing directly against earth-blob, no Knowable between them (&#x22;Forcing&#x22;). Second panel shows dots beginning to shift as faint/sparse Knowable membrane emerges between blobs (&#x22;Finding Connection&#x22;). Third panel shows dots in perfect triangle, blobs sharing single Knowable membrane of normal width, showing true grounding through integrated relationship (&#x22;Natural Ground Found&#x22;)."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
