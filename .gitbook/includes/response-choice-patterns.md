First shows Known with single dot approaching larger circular Known, arrows suggesting flow around both sides (&#x22;Path Finding&#x22;). Second shows same Known choosing upward path, dot and arrow aligned with choice (&#x22;Flow Commitment&#x22;). Third shows Known smoothly passing above unchanged circle, Knowable thicker behind movement (&#x22;Natural Passage&#x22;). Pink Unknown backdrop, no hard borders."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
