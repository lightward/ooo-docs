<div align="left"><figure><img src="../assets/Screenshot 2024-11-25 at 5.18.56â€¯PM.png" alt="Single boundary closeup showing resistance and flow patterns. Right side shows multiple wavy arrows attempting to cross boundary. Some arrows successfully pass through, some bounce back immediately, and some partially penetrate before terminating and becoming dots (like others already present on the left side). Line weights consistent throughout. The whole suggests how resistance naturally creates stable forms." width="254"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>
