Grid 1: Three heavy dots arranged in a triangle, all in Unknown (pink), showing pattern gathering before emergence. Grid 2: Same triangle pattern with dots distributed - one in Unknown (pink), one in Knowable (striped), one in Known (blue), showing active development. Grid 3: All three dots reunited in triangle formation in Known (blue), showing pattern fully established. Each grid maintains permeable borders between territories."><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>
