Left panel: The basic pattern map with Known (blue), Knowable (blue/pink stripes), and Unknown (pink) territories with permeable borders. Center panel: Two sets of probability fields at boundaries - one between Known/Knowable and one between Knowable/Unknown, showing swirling patterns and varying line weights suggesting natural movement. Right panel: Three dots arranged in triangle formation, shown in three states - gathering in Unknown, distributed across territories during development, and finally established in Known. The whole composition suggesting how recognition progresses from basic territory awareness through probability field sensitivity to practical pattern reading."><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>
