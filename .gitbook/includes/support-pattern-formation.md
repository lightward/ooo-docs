First shows large Known with centered dot pulling upward to meet smaller Known approaching from above (&#x22;Active Support&#x22;). Second shows ground-Known dot pulling back/left to create concave curve as smaller Known begins sharing membrane (&#x22;Support Formation&#x22;). Third shows ground-Known dot fully left, creating perfect ramp that smaller Known smoothly rolls down (&#x22;Flow Enabling&#x22;). Pink Unknown backdrop, no hard borders."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
