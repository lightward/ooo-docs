Labels below the line. Section 1 &#x22;possibility gathers&#x22;: dots concentrating from sparse to dense. Section 2 &#x22;resistance eases&#x22;: wavy lines becoming smoother. Section 3 &#x22;clarity emerges&#x22;: three-part sequence showing cross-hatched lines yielding to regular lines revealing letter A. Section 4 &#x22;renewal calls&#x22;: three-part sequence showing A transforming - first normal, then with horizontal bar rotated parallel to ascending bar, finally all lines rotated and resized to form y = -x graph (shown for x ≤ 0)."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
