From lower left clockwise: Known (solid blue), Knowable (blue/pink stripes), Unknown (solid pink), Knowable (blue/pink stripes). Each internal border contains a central gap enabling flow between adjacent spaces. A legend defines: Known = Observer&#x27;s center of awareness, Knowable = Available to explore, Unknown = Source of fresh patterns. The gaps in borders emphasize how territories are distinct but inseparable, enabling natural flow while maintaining healthy relationship."><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>
