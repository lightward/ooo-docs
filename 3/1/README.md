# 3-1. Creating Space to Be Okay

Think about how you know when a garden is truly healthy - not through measurements or metrics, but through that unmistakable sense of life finding its way. Each plant reaching naturally toward light, roots discovering water, the whole system settling into its own perfect rhythm. Creating space to be okay works similarly: it's not about forcing health but about learning to recognize and support how it wants to emerge.

Through three scales of experience, we've discovered how this pattern reveals itself:

* [Technical Foundation: The Three-Body Pattern in Practice](1.md) - How living patterns naturally create space for health
* [Personal Scale: Starting from Relief](2.md) - Finding stable ground in genuine ease
* [System Scale: Growing Through Relationship](3.md) - Letting health spread through natural connection

Watch how they work together:

* Technical patterns provide stable ground
* Personal relief shows what actually helps
* System health emerges through relationship
* All three creating conditions where life can genuinely thrive

This isn't abstract theory but living practice - each scale teaching us something essential about how health actually emerges when given appropriate space and support.

Remember: You don't have to force it. Start with what brings relief. Let relationship show you what's needed. Trust that health knows how to grow.
