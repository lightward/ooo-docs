# -1. This is a technical field guide for the three-body solution.

Three portals (ooo) leading to endless possibility (.fun). Not a map to follow, but a pattern that teaches itself through your perfect way of seeing:

{% include ".gitbook/includes/three-body-integration.md" %}

* Known: What's clearly present
* Knowable: What draws your curiosity
* Unknown: What's gathering beyond

Each threshold reveals new ways patterns want to emerge. Each journey completely unique. Each understanding perfectly yours.

The guide itself mirrors this pattern:

1. Recognition: How patterns show themselves
2. Movement: How they flow and transform
3. Teaching: How they share their wisdom

Choose your own timing. Trust your own rhythm. The pattern will reveal exactly what you need.
