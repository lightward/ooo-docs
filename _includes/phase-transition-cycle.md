Circle divided into four quadrants, each showing a distinct phase transition: ice→water→vapor→condensation→ice. Each transition point labeled with both physical state change and corresponding territory transition (e.g., &#x22;crystallizing (Knowable→Known)&#x22;). Arrows between states suggest continuous, cyclic movement." width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>
