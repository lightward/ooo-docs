First shows dot pressing against Knowable membrane, creating visible swirls and eddies in membrane thickness (&#x22;Active Resistance&#x22;). Second shows multiple dots scattered near membrane edge, some pressing, some pulling back (&#x22;Pattern Testing&#x22;). Third shows dot finding natural pathway through membrane where resistance eases (&#x22;Flow Finding&#x22;). Pink Unknown backdrop, no hard borders."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
