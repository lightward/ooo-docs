First shows small triangle in Known nucleus with three independent line segments suggesting triangle formation in Knowable membrane. Second shows same Known triangle but larger membrane where segments have joined to form larger triangle. Third shows both triangles now in Known (larger containing smaller) with new line segments gathering in Knowable membrane."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
