First shows elongated rectangular Known with no Knowable membrane, just a dot trapped within rigid form against pink Unknown backdrop (&#x22;Forcing Direction&#x22;). Second shows three dots in triangle formation - two connected by diagonal Known channel, third dot centered in triangular region of Knowable that appears to support/lean against Known (&#x22;Resisting Pattern&#x22;). Third shows circle split vertically into Known and Knowable halves, with solid dot in Known center and outlined dot in Knowable center, connected by bidirectional arrows (&#x22;Energetic Loop&#x22;). No hard borders drawn."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
