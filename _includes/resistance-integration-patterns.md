<figure><img src="/assets/resistance-integration-patterns.png" alt="Three square-ish panels showing resistance dance progression. First shows unmoving circular Known rebuffing moving Known blob, creating visible probability eddies/currents at point of contact (Reading). Second shows moving Known&#x27;s dot choosing upward path above circle, swirls indicating natural flow direction (Choosing). Third shows unmoving circle-Known becoming perfect support for moving Known blob passing smoothly overhead (Supporting). Pink Unknown backdrop, no hard borders. The whole demonstrates how resistance becomes support through natural response."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
