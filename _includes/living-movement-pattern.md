Three dots in triangle formation within circular Known, but with subtle suggestion of rotation/motion (perhaps through slight position variations or faint movement trails). Even Knowable membrane pulses slightly wider at three points aligned with triangle vertices, suggesting how stable pattern maintains living connection with possibility." width="545"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>
