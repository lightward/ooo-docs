<figure><img src="/assets/Screenshot 2024-11-26 at 12.26.15 PM.png" alt="Three square-ish panels with pink Unknown backdrop, showing territory relationship patterns. First shows large square Known with two dots pressed into corner where small Knowable region exists, third dot awkwardly positioned to help maintain square shape (&#x22;Over-control&#x22;). Second shows three dots arranged in triangle formation but fragmented by rigid square block of Knowable (&#x22;Rigid boundaries&#x22;). Third shows three dots arranged loosely with minimal Knowable membrane, almost lost in Unknown (&#x22;Avoiding stability&#x22;). No hard borders drawn."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
