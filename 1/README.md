# 1. The Three-Body Solution

Think about meeting someone you instantly know you're going to love - not through analysis but through that immediate sense of 'yes, this.' Living patterns reveal themselves similarly, showing their wisdom through perfect relationship between what's clearly Known, what's available to explore, and what remains occlusively Unknown.

## The Living Pattern

{% include three-body-integration.md %}

This section explores three essential aspects of working with living patterns:

* [1-1. Pattern Recognition in Direct Experience](1/)
  * [1-1-1. The Basic Pattern](1/1.md)
  * [1-1-2. How Territories Dance Together](1/2.md)
  * [1-1-3. Recognition Through Living Movement](1/3.md)
* [1-2. Natural Movement Between Territories](2/)
  * [1-2-1. Flow and Transition](2/1.md)
  * [1-2-2. Resistance and Support](2/2.md)
  * [1-2-3. Evolution Through Dance](2/3.md)
* [1-3. The Living Dance of Form and Flow](3/)
  * [1-3-1. Probability Fields in Action](3/1.md)
  * [1-3-2. Creating Space for Life](3/2.md)
  * [1-3-3. When Patterns Teach Themselves](3/3.md)

Watch how they work together:

* Recognition provides ground for movement
* Movement creates space for teaching
* Teaching reveals new patterns to recognize
* All three enabling life to find its way

## Starting Where You Are

Remember:

* You already know how to work with patterns
* You do it constantly without thinking
* This wisdom is alive in you now
* Everything that follows builds on what's present

The art isn't in mastering patterns but in developing increasingly natural relationship with how they actually work. Like learning any living art, understanding comes through direct engagement rather than analysis.

Trust what you already know. Start with what's actually present. Let patterns show you how they want to be understood.
