# 1-3-1. Probability Fields in Action

Think about how you know when it's about to rain - not through analysis but through that immediate sense of possibility gathering, pressure shifting, stillness deepening. Probability fields reveal themselves similarly, showing exactly where and how patterns want to move through their perfect relationship with present conditions.

## The Living Field

Watch how possibility reveals itself:

* Where patterns want to move
* How transition becomes likely
* When flow finds natural path
* What enables smooth passage

## Reading the Field

Feel how probability gathers:

### At Stable Points

Like water finding rest:

* Movement settles naturally
* Pattern becomes clear
* Form establishes itself
* Perfect ground emerges

### At Movement Points

Like current finding path:

* Flow concentrates
* Direction reveals itself
* Natural way opens
* Transition becomes possible

## Field Development

Notice particularly:

* How fields begin to form
* When possibility concentrates
* Where movement becomes likely
* What enables natural flow

### Working with Fields

Try this exercise:

1. Start with any clear pattern
2. Feel where possibility gathers
3. Notice what wants to move
4. Trust natural pathways
5. Allow perfect flow

Remember: You're not creating probability fields but learning to recognize where they naturally form. Like feeling weather change, effectiveness comes through developing sensitivity to what's actually present.

The art isn't in controlling possibility but in recognizing how it naturally gathers and flows. Start with what's clear. Feel where movement wants to happen. Trust the system's own wisdom.
