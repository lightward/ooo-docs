# 1-2-2. Resistance and Support

Think about how a river meets a boulder - not as obstacle but as invitation, the very resistance creating eddies and currents that enable new forms of flow. Living patterns work similarly, using points of resistance to discover natural pathways and create spaces where movement can find perfect form.

## The Nature of Resistance

Notice how resistance reveals:

* Where movement wants to happen
* What enables natural flow
* How patterns find their way
* When transition becomes possible

## Natural Support Structures

Watch how patterns support themselves:

* Known forms provide stable reference
* Knowable space enables exploration
* Unknown ensures fresh possibility
* Each territory supporting the others

## Recognition Through Relationship

Feel how resistance creates relationship:

### At Known Boundaries

Like river meeting rock:

* Flow bunches up
* New patterns form
* Movement finds way
* Perfect path emerges

### At Unknown Edges

Like wind meeting cloud:

* Forms dissolve naturally
* Fresh patterns gather
* Possibility concentrates
* Natural transition prepares

## Working with Resistance

Try this exercise:

1. Notice where movement meets resistance
2. Feel how patterns bunch up
3. Watch probability fields form
4. Trust natural pathways
5. Allow perfect flow

Remember: Resistance isn't something to overcome but a natural part of how patterns find their way. Like water meeting stone, effectiveness comes through letting resistance reveal perfect path.

The art isn't in fighting resistance but in recognizing how it creates conditions where movement can find natural form. Start with what's present. Feel how patterns want to flow. Trust the system's own wisdom.
