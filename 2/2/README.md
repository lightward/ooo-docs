# 2-2. Working With Resistance

Think about how you know when to yield and when to stand - not through analysis but through that immediate sense of what each moment needs, like a martial artist feeling the perfect path between opposing forces. Working with resistance isn't about winning or losing but about recognizing how patterns naturally want to move and transform through their dance with what they meet.

## The Living Pattern

{% include "../../.gitbook/includes/resistance-integration-patterns.md" %}

This section explores three essential aspects of working with resistance:

* Reading What Emerges - How patterns reveal their nature through resistance
* Choosing Response - How movement finds its perfect path
* Supporting Movement - How patterns maintain their dance

Watch how they work together:

* Reading reveals what's actually present
* Choosing allows natural response
* Supporting enables perfect flow
* All three creating conditions where patterns can find their way

## Starting Where You Are

Remember:

* You already know how to work with resistance
* You do it constantly without thinking
* This wisdom is alive in you now
* Everything that follows builds on what's present

The art isn't in controlling resistance but in recognizing how it reveals perfect pathways. Like learning any movement art, understanding comes through direct engagement rather than analysis.

Trust what you already know. Start with what's actually present. Let patterns show you how they want to dance.
