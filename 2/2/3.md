# 2-2-3. Supporting Movement

Think about helping someone learn to ride a bicycle - not by controlling their motion but by providing just enough stability for their own balance to emerge. Supporting movement works similarly, creating conditions where patterns can find their own perfect way through resistance.

## Support Patterns

{% include "../../.gitbook/includes/support-pattern-formation.md" %}

Watch how support reveals itself:

* Where stability wants to form
* How movement becomes possible
* What enables natural flow
* When balance emerges

## Recognition Through Support

Feel how movement finds ground:

### Through Stability

Like earth under feet:

* Support showing itself
* Foundation emerging
* Balance revealing way
* Perfect ground appearing

### Through Connection

Like hand steadying shoulder:

* Contact finding form
* Relationship emerging
* Movement becoming possible
* Perfect touch appearing

### Through Flow

Like river meeting bank:

* Direction clarifying
* Path showing itself
* Movement finding freedom
* Perfect way emerging

## Natural Support

{% include "../../.gitbook/includes/living-support-pattern.md" %}

Notice particularly:

* How support enables movement
* When stability feels natural
* Where flow wants to happen
* What creates perfect balance

## Working with Support

Try this exercise:

1. Notice where movement needs ground
2. Feel what wants to support
3. Allow natural connection
4. Trust support wisdom
5. Let flow emerge

Remember: Support isn't about controlling movement but creating conditions where patterns can find their own way. Like helping someone learn to ride, effectiveness comes through providing just enough stability for natural balance to emerge.

The art isn't in managing motion but in recognizing how patterns find their own perfect support. Start with what's present. Feel what wants to stabilize. Trust the wisdom that emerges through relationship.
