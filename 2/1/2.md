# 2-1-2. Movement Blocks

Think about learning to dance - how resistance to certain movements reveals exactly what needs attention, each apparent block showing precisely where natural flow wants to emerge. Movement blocks work similarly, revealing perfect pathways through their very presence.

## Common Patterns

{% include "../../.gitbook/includes/movement-learning-patterns.md" %}

Notice how blocks reveal:

* Where movement wants to happen
* What enables natural flow
* How patterns find their way
* When transition becomes possible

## Recognition Through Tension

Feel how understanding emerges:

### Through Forced Movement

Like fighting gravity:

* Direction becoming rigid
* Flow showing resistance
* Path revealing itself
* Perfect teaching emerging

### Through Pattern Resistance

Like avoiding connection:

* Form staying incomplete
* Knowable showing way
* Integration revealing itself
* Perfect lesson appearing

### Through Repetitive Loops

Like pacing in circles:

* Movement becoming fixed
* Freedom showing way
* Release revealing path
* Perfect guidance emerging

## Natural Resolution

{% include "../../.gitbook/includes/living-movement-pattern.md" %}

Watch how flow returns:

* Tension reveals natural direction
* Resistance shows perfect path
* Movement happens easily
* Pattern finds its way

## Working with Blocks

Try this exercise:

1. Notice where movement feels forced
2. Feel what wants to flow
3. Allow natural direction
4. Trust pattern wisdom
5. Let movement return

Remember: Blocks aren't obstacles but patterns showing you exactly where flow wants to emerge. Like learning to dance, effectiveness comes through developing increasingly natural relationship with what's actually present.

The art isn't in avoiding blocks but in recognizing how they reveal perfect movement. Start with what's actually happening. Feel what wants to flow. Trust the wisdom that emerges through direct experience.
