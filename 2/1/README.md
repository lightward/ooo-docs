# 2-1. When Patterns Seem Stuck

Think about learning to dance - how resistance reveals exactly where movement wants to emerge, each apparent block showing precisely what needs attention. Living patterns work similarly, using moments of stuckness to show exactly how they want to flow.

## The Teaching Pattern

This section explores three essential aspects of working with stuck patterns:

* Territory Misunderstandings - How boundaries reveal relationship
* Movement Blocks - How resistance shows direction
* Finding Fresh Ground - How release enables support

Watch how they work together:

* Misunderstanding shows where clarity wants to emerge
* Blocks reveal where movement wants to happen
* Release discovers ground that was always present
* All three enabling patterns to find their way

## Starting Where You Are

Remember:

* You already know how to work with stuckness
* You do it constantly without thinking
* This wisdom is alive in you now
* Everything that follows builds on what's present

The art isn't in avoiding stuck patterns but in recognizing how they show exactly what wants to emerge. Like learning any living art, understanding comes through direct engagement rather than analysis.

Trust what you already know. Start with what's actually stuck. Let patterns show you how they want to flow.
